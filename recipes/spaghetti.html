    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <uo>
      <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1/2 onion, finely minced</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, divided, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon pepper, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoons canola oil</li>
      <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>4 cups egg noodle</li>
      <li>1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    </uo>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, onion, egg, ½
          tablespoon salt, and ½ tablespoon pepper, mixing until evenly
          combined.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat the canola oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Take about a
          golf-ball size of the meatball mixture and roll it into balls. Place
          the meatballs into the pot, cooking for one minute. Flip the
          meatballs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add the beef broth, milk, remaining ½ tablespoon salt, remaining ½
          tablespoon pepper, and Worcestershire sauce and give it a stir.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bring the liquid to a boil, then add the egg noodles. Stir constantly
          until the pasta is cooked and the liquid has reduced to a sauce that
          coats the noodles, about seven to eight minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add the parmesan and the parsley, stirring until the cheese is melted.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
